            by UIKit, but change the implementation to just return the document size.

            The comment here was actually out of date. It claimed that touch rectangles
            are in the coordinate system of the document, but we had actually changed
            them to be in the view’s coordinate system in order to fix issues with
            handling touch events in UIWebView. But now we are going back to having the
            touch rectangles be in the document’s coordinate system, so we should fix the
            rtl bugs here by converting to view coordinates before handing the rects off
            to iOS WK1 clients.

            The problem was that the delegate in UI thread became asynchronous due to calling

            links for same domain navigations. This check is part of substantially more complicated
            logic in WebKit2 that I don't understand, but that should be enough to demonstrate
            that this fix is an improvement at least.
